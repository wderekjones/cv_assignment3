# cv_assignment3
estimate the camera projection matrix, compute epipolar lines and matching.

## Part 1
To run the driver program for part 1 of the assignment, (from the matlab command window):
>> part1

For each of the 10 cameras a projection matrix is estimated along with a camera center and a camera rotaion matrix.
The outputs are indexed by the camera indices.

## Part 2
To run the driver program for part 2 of the assignment:
>> part2

For each of the image pairs, a fundamental matrix is estimated, a set of epipolar lines for each of the images are
visualized along with the set of inlier matches.



The respective outputs will be located with the folders proj3/part1 and proj3/part2.
